title: Kubernetes on the Tech ONTAP Podcast
---

In the past month, I joined the Tech ONTAP Podcast for Episode 245: *Containers, Kubernetes and Automation in Dev and QA at NetApp*. 

Co-hosted by [Justin Parisi](https://twitter.com/NFSDudeAbides) and [Jonathan Rippy](https://twitter.com/jkrippy), this episode focused on how NetApp's Dev and QA organizations are modernizing their tools and infrastructure.
Specifically, we go into how Kubernetes, and its ecosystem, have fueled collaboration across product silos.

You can listen to the podcast nearly everywhere, but here are some helpful links...

It was my first ever podcast appearance, and I am very thankful for it.
Definitely need to work on some things for my next episode, but I think this one came out well.
Please enjoy!
