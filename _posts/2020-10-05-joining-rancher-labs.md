title: Joining Rancher Labs
---

I am excited to say that I have joined [Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com/) as a Software Engineer!
 
I'll be starting my "first day" this morning, so I wanted to talk about why I joined Rancher, and why I am excited to work with everyone there.

In my [last post](https://nickgerace.dev/post/leaving-netapp), I spoke about wanting to try new things *eventually*, and continuing to explore what being a Software Engineer is all about.
I also spoke about the foundations of high-level career/engineering motivations (e.g. caring about principles and mission over technology `foo` or `bar`).
The COVID-19 era helped accelerate my desire to try new things; the top three being (in no particular order)... 

1. Product development
1. Working on open source software full-time
1. Working at a small company

Rancher Labs not only gives me an opportunity to do those three things well, but also provides motivation to do so.
From speaking with future teammates, including senior members of the company, I'm confident in both Rancher's goal to be the undisputed leader in enterprise Kubernetes management, and its commitment to its organizational values and principles, which flow into every single product.

The proof is out in the open too.
Here are some highlights on Rancher's success, alongside other noteworthy metrics, over the past few years...

- *["claimed annualized revenue growth of 169% in 2019 without specifying a dollar amount"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs.html)*
- *["76% of enterprises worldwide are set to standardize on Kubernetes by 2022"](https://rancher.com/press/rancher-labs-raises-series-d-fundraising-to-accelerate-growth-of-kubernetes-management-platform)*
- *["increased its number of customers by 52 percent since the start of 2019, the best first half of a year since the company launched its first product in 2016"](https://rancher.com/press/2019-07-23-rancher-labs-accelerates-momentum-release/)*

There's a few more articles out there that I like, but I believe that the company's path to success is clear.

So... let's address the elephant in the room: [didn't SUSE announce its intent to acquire Rancher Labs in July](https://rancher.com/press/suse-to-acquire-rancher), Nick?
Does that concern you?

*Not in the slightest*.
I definitely had more than a few questions about this subject though.
However, after a few conversations, I am actually *very motivated* by the news.

I would dive into my feelings and opinions on this further, but I am not an official spokesperson for SUSE or Rancher Labs.
I'll keep it at this: SUSE's and Rancher's goals are clearer than ever, and they are both in it for the long haul.
It's *very* exciting.

The last thing I'll mention is that I am staying on the East Coast (US) for the foreseeable future.
Open source software and remote work have helped each other blossom, and Rancher and SUSE have talented folks from all around the world.
Thus, to my local friends, as always, don't be a stranger!

I'll wrap up this post quickly because I have to get things together, like *annihilating Slack email notifications on my new account*.
The bottom line: **the work that Rancher Labs is doing is inspiring, and I am more than thrilled to be a part of it**.
